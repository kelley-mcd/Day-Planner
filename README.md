# Day-Planner
Homework 5: Work day scheduler
the daily schedule planner is an easy to use planner for the everday busy person.
each hour, starting at 6am and ending at 6pm, is laid out and ready for the user to input how their day is going to be structured.
the hour slots are also color coded to easily show the user how their schedule is looking by having the hours that ahve passed in grey, the present hour in red, and the future hours in green.
once the user has input each hour of their day and hit the 'save' button, the local storage will save the users inputs so the user can come back to their schedule at a later time and still ahve their data saved.
